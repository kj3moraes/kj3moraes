# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Keane Moraes and I am 3A university student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I am working on embeddings, natural language and knowledge management. 

I'm trying to build a system where when people take notes, over time the notes give back to them by helping the notetaker find insights, common themes and connections between ideas and fields. AI and NLP is my best shot at doing this and that's why I am building in this space.
