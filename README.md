# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Keane Moraes and I am 3A university student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I am working on embeddings, NLP and knowledge management. 

I'm trying to build a system where when people take notes, over time the notes give back to them by helping the notetaker find insights, common themes and connections between ideas and fields. You can perform ODQA, semantic similarity and define agents on it. AI and NLP is my best shot at doing this and that's why I am building in this space.

I've recently started learning Rust and decided to take up two mini-projects:
1. [Rusticade](https://github.com/kj3moraes/rusticade) - a CLI program that allows me to play old Atari 2600 games like Frogger and Asteroids
2. [larking](https://github.com/kj3moraes/larking) - a simulaton of an evolutionary algorithm in Rust based of Patryk27's [amazing shorelark tutorial](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/)
